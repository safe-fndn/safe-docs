## Overview

Safenet Beta distributes rewards to validators and delegators every two weeks (the "reward period") in recognition of their contribution to securing the network. The reward mechanism is stake-weighted and designed with built-in safeguards to discourage centralization and support a balanced, resilient validator set.

**Time-weighted stake**

- Rewards are calculated using the **average staked balance over the reward period**, not a single snapshot.
- For both validators and delegators, stake is treated as a **time-weighted average** of the balance held during the reward period.

**Stake-weighted rewards with centralization caps**

- Rewards grow **linearly with total stake** up to a threshold **T**.
- Above **T**, rewards grow **sub-linearly** (proportional to √x), reducing incentives for oversized validators.
- The threshold is defined as the total network stake divided by the number of active validators.

**Minimum validator self-stake requirement**

- Validators must maintain a minimum average self-stake of **3,500,000 SAFE** during the reward period.
- Validators below this threshold receive **no validator rewards** for that period.
- Delegators who delegated to such validators remain eligible to receive rewards, provided the validator meets the participation requirement.

**Participation-based eligibility**

- Rewards are conditional on validator participation.
- Validators with participation below **75%** during the reward period generate **no rewards**.
- If a validator fails to meet the participation threshold, neither the validator nor its delegators receive rewards for that reward period.

**Validator commission**

- Validators charge a **5% commission** on rewards generated by delegated stake.
- **95%** of delegated rewards are distributed to delegators.
- **5%** is retained by the validator, in addition to rewards earned on their own stake (if eligible).

**Minimum payout threshold**

- Rewards are only paid out if the recipient is entitled to at least **1 SAFE token** for the reward period.
- This prevents economically inefficient micro-payouts.
- Any unpaid rewards are carried forward and added to the reward pool of the next reward period.

## Calculation

This section provides the formal definition of the Safenet Beta reward mechanism.  
All stake values are time-averaged over the reward period.

**Glossary**

*Sets and participants*

- $V$ – set of active validators  
- $N = |V|$ – number of active validators  

*Stake*

- $\bar s_i$ - average SAFE tokens self-staked by validator $i$ over the reward period  
- $\bar d_{j,i}$ - average SAFE tokens delegated by delegator $j$ to validator $i$  
- $\bar d_i = \sum_j \bar d_{j,i}$ - total average delegated stake to validator $i$  
- $\bar S_i = \bar s_i + \bar d_i$ - total average stake backing validator $i$  
- $\bar S_{\text{total}} = \sum_{i \in V} \bar S_i$ - total average stake in the network  

*Participation*

- $p_i \in [0,1]$ - participation rate of validator $i$ during the reward period  
- $p_{\min} = 0.75$ - minimum participation threshold required to earn rewards  

*Minimum self-stake requirement*

- $s_{\min} = 3{,}500{,}000$ SAFE  

*Rewards*

- $\Delta t$ - duration of the reward period
- $R$ - total reward pool distributed in the reward period  
- $R_i$ - reward allocated to validator $i$ before commission  
- $R_i^{\text{self}}$ - portion of $R_i$ attributable to validator self-stake  
- $R_i^{\text{del}}$ - portion of $R_i$ attributable to delegated stake  
- $R_i^{\text{validator}}$ - total reward earned by validator $i$ before minimum payout filtering  
- $R_i^{\text{delegators}}$ - total reward allocated to delegators of validator $i$  
- $R_{j,i}$ - reward allocated to delegator $j$ for delegation to validator $i$  

*Incentive parameters*

- $T$ - stake threshold where linear rewards stop  
- $c = 0.05$ - validator commission rate on delegated rewards  
- $m = 1$ - minimum payout threshold (in SAFE tokens)  

*Weights*

- $w(\bar S_i)$ - stake-based reward weight for validator $i$  
- $\tilde w_i$ - effective reward weight after participation filtering  

*Payouts*

- $P_i$ - raw reward payout allocated to validator $i$ **before applying the minimum payout rule**
- $P_{j,i}$ - raw reward payout allocated to delegator $j$ **before applying the minimum payout rule**
- $\hat P_i$ - final reward payout transferred to validator $i$ **after applying the minimum payout rule**
- $\hat P_{j,i}$ - final reward payout transferred to delegator $j$ **after applying the minimum payout rule**
- $R_{\text{paid}}$ - total rewards paid out in the reward period  
- $R_{\text{unpaid}}$ - rewards not paid out and carried forward  

**Time-averaged stake**

For any stake balance $x(t)$ over the reward period $[t_0, t_1]$ with $\Delta t = t_1 - t_0$, the time-average is defined as:

$$
\bar x = \frac{1}{\Delta t} \int_{t_0}^{t_1} x(t)\, dt
$$

**Stake threshold**

The linear reward threshold is defined as the average stake per validator:

$$
T = \frac{\bar S_{\text{total}}}{N}
$$

**Stake weighting function**

Rewards grow linearly up to $T$ and sub-linearly beyond $T$:

$$
w(\bar S_i) =
\begin{cases}
\bar S_i, & \text{if } \bar S_i \le T \\
T + \sqrt{\bar S_i - T}, & \text{if } \bar S_i > T
\end{cases}
$$

This penalizes oversized validators and incentivizes delegation toward smaller validators.

**Participation filter**

Validators must satisfy the minimum participation requirement in order for **any rewards (validator or delegator)** to be generated for that validator:

$$
\tilde w_i =
\begin{cases}
p_i \cdot w(\bar S_i), 
& \text{if } p_i \ge p_{\min} \\
0, 
& \text{if } p_i < p_{\min}
\end{cases}
$$

If $p_i < p_{\min}$, no rewards are generated for validator $i$ or its delegators during that reward period.

The minimum self-stake requirement affects validator earnings only:

If $\bar s_i < s_{\min}$ and $p_i \ge p_{\min}$, the validator forfeits its validator reward share, while delegator rewards remain unaffected.

**Reward allocation across validators**

$$
W = \sum_{k \in V} \tilde w_k
$$

Validator $i$’s reward allocation:

$$
R_i = R \cdot \frac{\tilde w_i}{W}
$$

**Split between validator and delegators**

*Attribution by stake source*

Reward attributable to validator self-stake:

$$
R_i^{\text{self}} = R_i \cdot \frac{\bar s_i}{\bar S_i}
$$

Reward attributable to delegated stake:

$$
R_i^{\text{del}} = R_i \cdot \frac{\bar d_i}{\bar S_i}
$$

*Commission split*

If $\bar s_i \ge s_{\min}$:

$$
R_i^{\text{validator}} = R_i^{\text{self}} + c \cdot R_i^{\text{del}}
$$

If $\bar s_i < s_{\min}$:

$$
R_i^{\text{validator}} = 0
$$

Delegator earnings:

$$
R_i^{\text{delegators}} =
\begin{cases}
(1 - c) \cdot R_i^{\text{del}}, & \text{if } \bar s_i \ge s_{\min} \\
R_i^{\text{del}}, & \text{if } \bar s_i < s_{\min}
\end{cases}
$$

**Per-delegator reward**

$$
R_{j,i} = R_i^{\text{delegators}} \cdot \frac{\bar d_{j,i}}{\bar d_i}
$$

**Minimum payout rule**

Raw payouts:

$$
P_i = R_i^{\text{validator}}
$$

$$
P_{j,i} = R_{j,i}
$$

Final payouts:

$$
\hat P_i =
\begin{cases}
P_i, & \text{if } P_i \ge m \\
0, & \text{if } P_i < m
\end{cases}
$$

**Final delegator payout**

$$
\hat P_{j,i} =
\begin{cases}
P_{j,i}, & \text{if } P_{j,i} \ge m \\
0, & \text{if } P_{j,i} < m
\end{cases}
$$

**Total rewards paid out:**

$$
R_{\text{paid}} =
\sum_{i \in V} \hat P_i
+
\sum_{i \in V} \sum_j \hat P_{j,i}
$$

**Unpaid rewards:**

$$
R_{\text{unpaid}} = R - R_{\text{paid}}
$$

Unpaid rewards remain in the reward pool and are carried forward to the next reward period.

## Distribution

Rewards are calculated offchain and distributed onchain via a Merkle distributor contract.

Once allocated, rewards do not expire. Recipients must actively claim their rewards either:

- Directly from the Merkle distributor contract, or  
- Through the dedicated staking / claiming interface.

## Compliance

As rewards are funded by assets held on the books of the Safe Ecosystem Foundation (SEF), KYC and AML requirements apply.

- Addresses sanctioned by OFAC, as identified through [Chainalysis’ on-chain oracle](https://go.chainalysis.com/chainalysis-oracle-docs.html), are excluded from receiving rewards.
- Addresses receiving rewards exceeding the equivalent of USD 1,000 within a two-week payout period are required to complete a KYC process prior to distribution.
