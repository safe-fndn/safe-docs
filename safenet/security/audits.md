## Safenet Staking Contract

### Beta

Chain: Mainnet
The Safenet Beta Staking contract has undergone an audit, the report for which can be found [here](https://github.com/safe-research/shieldnet/blob/main/contracts/audits/audit.md). This audit focused on identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring the security of the staking mechanisms within the Safenet Beta.

## Safenet Consensus Contract

Chain: Gnosis Chain
The Safenet Consensus contract has not undergone an audit yet as the contract is owned, and no user funds will be directly at risk. The consensus contract currently only has two main functions:
- Post transaction for attestation
- Collect attestation

An audit will be performed on a later stage.
