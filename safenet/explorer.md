title: Safenet Beta Explorer
sidebarTitle: Explorer
description: A public interface for Safenet Beta. It provides a transparent view into Safe transactions that are proposed and checked by the Safenet Beta validator set. 
---

The Explorer is available at _TODO_.

TODO: Add screenshots of UI.

# Explore network activity

- Live stream of recently proposed Safe transactions
- Status tracking: **Proposed**, **Attested**, **Timed-out** 
- Search by Safe address or safeTxHash

Each transaction has a dedicated detail page showing:

- Safe transaction summary and decoding
- Proposal history and attestation status
- Validator participation
- Links to Safe\{Wallet\} and chain explorers (if available)

# Submit a proposal

If a Safe transaction has not yet been proposed to Safenet Beta, it can be submitted directly from the explorer.

- No wallet connection required
- Sponsored relayer submission
- Manual entry or SafeTxHash prefill

The Explorer is intentionally simple in Beta and focused on transparency and observability. It will evolve alongside the Safenet protocol.
