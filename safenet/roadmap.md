# Q1 2026 - Safenet Beta & SAFE Staking

Safenet Beta marks the first live deployment of the network, focused on validator coordination and core consensus with a permissioned validator set.

**Focus areas**

- Launch of the Safenet Beta network  
- Validator onboarding and coordination  
- Initial SAFE token staking mechanics  
- Basic transaction attestation flow  
- Explorer and network monitoring tools  

This phase validates the core architecture, staking mechanics, and validator participation in a controlled production environment.


# Q2 2026 - Advanced Checks & Guard Enforcement

Safenet expands its transaction verification capabilities with more advanced security logic and enforceable guard integrations.

**Focus areas**

- Expanded transaction security checks  
- Improved attack pattern detection  
- Guard-level enforcement mechanisms  
- Configurable security policy frameworks  
- Validator performance monitoring  

This phase strengthens Safenet’s ability to proactively prevent malicious or high-risk transactions before execution.


# Q3 2026 - Safe{Wallet} Integration & Fee Implementation

Safenet integrates directly into wallet flows and introduces a sustainable economic model.

**Focus areas**

- Native Safe{Wallet} integrations  
- Seamless transaction proposal UX  
- Fee model design and implementation  
- Validator reward distribution logic  
- Delegator participation improvements  

This phase improves accessibility for end users while aligning long-term incentives across validators and token holders.


# Q4 2026 - Transaction Check Markets

Safenet evolves into a market-based coordination layer for transaction validation.

**Focus areas**

- Transaction check specialization  
- Market-based pricing for validation services  
- Validator reputation mechanisms  
- Competitive security service dynamics  

This phase introduces economic competition to optimize security quality, responsiveness, and efficiency.


# 2027+ - Economic Slashing & Transaction Insurance

Safenet transitions toward stronger crypto-economic guarantees and optional protection layers.

**Focus areas**

- Slashing mechanisms for validator misbehavior  
- Cryptoeconomic accountability guarantees  
- Risk-weighted validation models  
- Transaction insurance primitives  
- Advanced security assurances  

This phase establishes Safenet as a fully incentive-aligned security layer with enforceable accountability and optional insurance coverage.
