## Why deploy a Safe on multiple chains?

Deploying the same Safe Smart Account on multiple chains can be useful in several scenarios:

- **Accidental fund transfers**  
  If funds are mistakenly sent to a chain where the Safe has not yet been deployed, deploying the Safe on that chain allows the funds to be recovered.

- **Cross-chain operations**  
  Users and teams operating across multiple chains benefit from having the **same Safe address** everywhere, simplifying treasury management, access control, and operational workflows.

---

## How it works

A Safe can be deployed on multiple chains at the **same address** by replaying the original deployment using deterministic contract creation.

In addition to manually constructing the deployment transaction, Safe provides the following supported options:

- **Safe\{Wallet\} UI**  
  The Safe\{Wallet\} interface allows users to deploy an existing Safe to additional chains using the same address.

- **Safe Protocol Kit**  
  The Safe Protocol Kit supports multi-chain Safe deployments programmatically.  
  See the [Protocol Kit multi-chain deployment guide](https://docs.safe.global/sdk/protocol-kit/guides/multichain-safe-deployment).

### Deployment process

Multi-chain deployment is performed via the **Safe Proxy Factory** using deterministic deployment (`CREATE2`).

The resulting Safe address is derived from the following inputs:

- Proxy Factory contract address
- Safe Singleton contract address
- Deployment salt
- `initializer` calldata
- Proxy creation bytecode

As long as all inputs are identical, the deployed Safe address will be the same across chains.

## Exceptions and limitations

- **Non-EVM chains**  
  This method only works on EVM-compatible chains. Non-EVM chains (for example, zkSync Era) are not supported.

- **Version compatibility**  
  Safes created using Singleton **v1.3.0 or later** are compatible with multi-chain deployment.  
  Safes created from Singletons **v1.0.0, v1.1.1, or v1.2.0** cannot be replayed on additional chains using this method.

---

## Important considerations

When deploying a Safe across multiple chains, keep the following in mind:

- **Identical configuration**  
  The Safe deployed on another chain will start with the *exact same configuration* as the original Safe at deployment time, including owners, threshold, and enabled modules. All required owner keys must be available to access and manage the Safe on the new chain.

- **Security assumptions**  
  Do not use this method if any of the initial owner keys are compromised, as the compromised configuration will be replicated on the new chain.

- **Version immutability**  
  The Singleton version used during deployment is fixed. You cannot change the Singleton version while replaying the deployment on additional chains.

By understanding these constraints and guarantees, you can safely deploy and operate the same Safe Smart Account across multiple chains.
